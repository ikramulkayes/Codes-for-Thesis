# Understanding QA generation: Extracting Parametric and Contextual Knowledge with CQA for Low Resource Bangla Language

This repository contains the code used for various stages of our thesis work, including model inference, answer extraction, and output evaluation.

## Folder Structure and Descriptions

### 1. Model Output Generation

The following folders are used to run different language models on the dataset to generate outputs:

- `Deepsekk 32B Distil Model run`  
- `Llama3.3 70B Model Run`  
- `Qwq 32B Model Run`

Each folder contains the scripts and configurations required to perform inference using the respective models.

---

### 2. Answer Extraction

The `extracting` folders are used to process the raw outputs generated by the models and extract the target answers. These scripts help in cleaning, formatting, and isolating the relevant answer components for evaluation.

---

### 3. Output Evaluation

- `evaluation gemeni`  
This folder includes the evaluation scripts that utilize the Gemini model to assess the quality and correctness of the model-generated outputs against ground truth answers.

Feel free to explore each folder for more detailed scripts and usage instructions.
